## CDN Fundamentals

### What is a CDN?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of servers that work together to deliver website content (such as HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos) to users from the nearest possible node, providing faster and more reliable content access.

### How Does a CDN Work?

When a user visits a website that uses a CDN, the following steps occur:

1. User enters the website domain (e.g., <www.example.com>) in their browser
2. CDN's DNS service directs the request to the nearest CDN node
3. If the content is cached at that node, it's delivered directly to the user
4. If not cached, the node retrieves content from the origin server, caches it, and then delivers it to the user

### Benefits of Using CDNs

CDNs provide several key benefits for frontend applications:

- **Faster Loading Speed** - Reduced latency through proximity-based content delivery
- **Lower Bandwidth Costs** - Distributed server load and reduced bandwidth usage
- **Improved Availability** - Multiple node redundancy prevents single points of failure
- **Enhanced Security** - Provides DDoS protection and other security features
